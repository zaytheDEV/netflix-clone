Netflix Clone

Hi, thank you for reviewing my Netflix Clone project. 

<b>Main Objective</b></br>
The objective of this project was to get a better understanding with React and API requests. This project contains a login portal hosted by Firebase. Just like the Netflix sign-in and sign-up page, the user can make an account and login or out of their account. For the movie previews/trailers, I used IMDB API and YouTube extension. The extension pulls the trailer of the selected movie from YouTube’s database. 

This was my second project that I developed using React. Looking back at this project, I can see how my coding style drastically evolved from a beginner to more of a professional level. There weren’t any actual coding mistakes in this project, but the class names could have been approved and the CSS styling could have been approved as well. I wanted to leave the code how I first wrote it to see and compare my code from then till now. I am now able to write better comments, consistent name schemes, clever and readable code.
